this program takes 3 numbers as input and compares them to sort them and return the numbers sorted

take 3 numbers as input
create an empty list to store the sorted numbers
IF all 3 numbers are equal return the same input in that order

ELSE take number1 and compare to number2 and number3 
	IF number1 is higher than both number2 and number3, number1 will be in the first position
		take the remaining 2 numbers number2 and number3 and compare them
		IF number2 is higher or equal to number3 
			put the numbers to sorted list in the following order [number1,number2,number3]
		ELSE  put the numbers to sorted list in the following order [number1,number3,number2]
	ELSE-IF  number1 is higher than number2 only
		put the numbers to sorted list in the following order [number3,number1,number2]
	ELSE-IF number1 is higher than number3
		put the numbers to sorted list in the following order [number2,number1,number3]
	ELSE take number2 and compare to number3
		IF number2 is higher or equal to number3:
			put the numbers to sorted list in the following order [number2,number3,number1]
		ELSE put the numbers to sorted list in the following order [number3,number2,number1]
return sorted
